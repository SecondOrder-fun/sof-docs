# SecondOrder.fun Product Framework

## Executive Summary

SecondOrder.fun transforms memecoins from chaotic, scam-prone infinite games into structured, fair finite games using game theory principles. We're not making crypto games - we're making crypto into a game.

## Core Problem Statement

### The Memecoin Prisoner's Dilemma

- Traditional memecoins are assumed to be infinite games
- Prisoner's Dilemma dynamics incentivize the first person to dump and "win"
- This turns infinite games into finite games through perverse incentives
- Result: Rug pulls, exit scams, and community destruction

### Why Technical Solutions Fail

- Memecoin scams are fundamentally a **people problem, not a tech problem**
- Technical safeguards miss the root cause: misaligned incentives
- Need to align player incentives through game design, not just technology

## The SecondOrder.fun Solution

### Making Memecoins Finite Games (By Design)

Transform memecoins into structured finite games with three key features:

#### 1. Clearly Stated Rules

- Define the terms of the game (raffle mechanics)
- Set clear conditions for winning and losing
- Establish transparent, credibly neutral framework

#### 2. Time-Limited Utility

- Memecoins function as **raffle tickets** with explicit utility
- Utility is priced into the coin's value upfront
- 2-week season structure with defined start/end dates

#### 3. Terminal Value Event

- Game ends when utility expires
- Prisoner's Dilemma becomes part of strategy, not a fear
- Players can plan around known endpoints

## The Two-Layer System

### Layer 1: Base Game (Finite Memecoin Raffle)

**Season Structure:**

- 2-week seasons with new memecoin each cycle
- Pre-set winner pools (3/5/10 winners based on initial rules)
- Clear start/end dates known upfront

**Ticket Acquisition:**

- Primary market: Bonding curve denominated in $SOF project token
- Secondary market: P2P trading between players
- Transparent pricing and supply mechanics

**Game Resolution:**

- Random drawing at season end
- Winners receive predetermined prizes
- Clear, verifiable outcome

### Layer 2: Second Order Play (Prediction Markets)

**Derivative Trading:**

- Onchain prediction markets price each position's win probability
- Players buy/sell derivatives on specific positions
- Real-time odds based on market sentiment

**Hedging Opportunities:**

- Hold tickets, short your own position
- Profit regardless of raffle outcome
- Complex strategies emerge from simple mechanics

**Market Dynamics:**

- "Gambling on gamblers" meta-game
- Liquidity provision opportunities
- Arbitrage between layers

## Revenue Model & Tokenomics

### Phase 1: Bootstrap

- External sponsor funding for initial prizes
- Focus on user acquisition and proving mechanics
- Build liquidity and community

### Phase 2: Self-Sustaining

- Transaction fees from both layers fund prize pools
- Platform revenue from trading volume
- Sustainable economics through user activity

### $SOF Token Utility

- Denomination currency for bonding curves
- Creates natural demand for $SOF tokens
- Platform governance and premium features
- **Open Question:** Post-season $SOF token management

## Key Value Propositions
