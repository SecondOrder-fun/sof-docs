# MetaMask Permissions Issue - Documentation & Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-10-05

## Summary

Resolved the persistent MetaMask "white icon" and "Reload this page" issue. Root cause was Chrome extension permissions, NOT code. Created comprehensive documentation and reorganized project docs.

## Root Cause

**Chrome Extension Permission Issue:**
- MetaMask's site access permission was set to "When you click the extension"
- Chrome resets this after browser/extension updates
- Causes provider re-initialization warnings

**Fix:** Change MetaMask site access to "On all sites" in Chrome extension settings.

## Documentation Created

### New Documentation

- **`docs/03-development/metamask-chrome-permissions-fix.md`** - Definitive guide to the permissions issue
  - Step-by-step fix instructions
  - Root cause explanation
  - Prevention strategies
  - Troubleshooting guide

### Files Moved from Root to Docs

Cleaned up root directory by moving documentation to proper locations:

1. **`METAMASK_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FIX.md`** → `docs/03-development/`
2. **`METAMASK_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** → `docs/03-development/`
3. **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** → `docs/07-changelog/2025-10/`
4. **`IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`** → `docs/03-development/`
5. **`REDIS_USERNAME_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** → `docs/03-development/`
6. **`SOF_TRANSACTION_HISTORY_FINAL.md`** → `docs/03-development/`
7. **`SOF_TRANSACTION_HISTORY_SUMMARY.md`** → `docs/03-development/`
8. **`USERNAME_FEATURE_README.md`** → `docs/03-development/`

### Updated Documentation

- **`docs/03-development/README.md`** - Added new "MetaMask & Wallet Integration" section with prominent link to permissions fix

## Code Changes (Incidental Improvements)

While investigating, updated code to follow RainbowKit v2 best practices:

### WagmiConfigProvider.jsx

- Switched from manual `createConfig` to `getDefaultConfig` from RainbowKit
- Added `ssr: false` for client-only app
- Added `multiInjectedProviderDiscovery: false` to prevent provider re-discovery
- Config created once at module load (singleton pattern)

### main.jsx

- Added `initialChain` prop to `RainbowKitProvider`
- Bumped cache version to `1.0.5`

**Note:** These code changes improve architecture but did NOT fix the permissions issue.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Chrome extension permissions can reset after updates** - Not a code bug
2. **MetaMask needs "On all sites" permission** - "When you click" mode causes reload warnings
3. **Document user-facing issues prominently** - Save future debugging time
4. **Keep root directory clean** - Move docs to proper structure

## Prevention

- Check MetaMask permissions after Chrome/MetaMask updates
- Display `MetaMaskPermissionHelp` component when wallet connection fails
- Reference the new comprehensive guide: `docs/03-development/metamask-chrome-permissions-fix.md`
