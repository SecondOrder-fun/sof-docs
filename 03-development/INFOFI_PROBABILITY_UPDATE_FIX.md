# InfoFi Market Probability Update Fix

## Problem

When a player bought or sold tickets, only their own InfoFi market odds were updated. Other players' markets showed stale probabilities even though their win chances changed mathematically.

**Example:**
- Player 1 buys tickets → gets 100% odds ✅
- Player 2 buys tickets → gets 33.3% odds ✅
- Player 1's market still shows 100% odds ❌ (should be 66.7%)

## Root Cause

The `InfoFiMarketFactory.updateProbability()` function only emitted `ProbabilityUpdated` events for the single player whose position changed, not for all affected players.

## Solution

Leverage the existing `RafflePositionTracker` contract to update ALL players after any position change.

### Architecture Flow

```
Buy/Sell Tickets
    ↓
SOFBondingCurve
    ↓
RafflePositionTracker.updateAllPlayersInSeason()
    ↓
Loop through all participants
    ↓
Emit PositionSnapshot for each player
    ↓
Backend Listener catches events
    ↓
Update database (infofi_markets.current_probability)
    ↓
Frontend displays updated odds
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Contract Changes

#### `contracts/src/core/RafflePositionTracker.sol`
- ✅ Added `MAX_PLAYERS_PER_UPDATE = 250` constant for gas safety
- ✅ Added `updateAllPlayersInSeason()` function
- ✅ Added `_updatePlayerInternalWithTotal()` helper to avoid redundant RPC calls
- ✅ Added `getParticipants()` to `IRaffleContract` interface

**Key Function:**
```solidity
function updateAllPlayersInSeason() external onlyRole(MARKET_ROLE) {
    uint256 seasonId = raffle.currentSeasonId();
    address[] memory players = raffle.getParticipants(seasonId);
    
    if (players.length == 0) return;
    
    // Get total tickets once to save gas
    (, , , uint256 totalTickets, ) = raffle.getSeasonDetails(seasonId);
    
    // Limit to MAX_PLAYERS_PER_UPDATE for gas safety
    uint256 updateCount = players.length > MAX_PLAYERS_PER_UPDATE 
        ? MAX_PLAYERS_PER_UPDATE 
        : players.length;
    
    // Update each player with pre-fetched totalTickets
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < updateCount; i++) {
        _updatePlayerInternalWithTotal(players[i], seasonId, totalTickets);
    }
    
    seasonLastUpdateBlock[seasonId] = block.number;
}
```

#### `contracts/src/curve/SOFBondingCurve.sol`
- ✅ Updated `IRafflePositionTracker` interface to include `updateAllPlayersInSeason()`
- ✅ Changed `buyTokens()` to call `updateAllPlayersInSeason()` instead of `updatePlayerPosition()`
- ✅ Changed `sellTokens()` to call `updateAllPlayersInSeason()` instead of `updatePlayerPosition()`
- ✅ Removed `infoFiFactory` storage variable and `setInfoFiFactory()` function
- ✅ Removed all calls to `IInfoFiMarketFactory.onPositionUpdate()`
- ✅ Removed `IInfoFiMarketFactory` import

#### `contracts/src/core/Raffle.sol`
- ✅ Removed `setInfoFiFactory()` call from `createSeason()`

#### `contracts/src/core/SeasonFactory.sol`
- ✅ Removed `setInfoFiFactory()` call from `deploySeason()`

### 2. Backend Changes

#### New File: `backend/src/services/positionTrackerListener.js`
- ✅ Listens to `PositionSnapshot` events from `RafflePositionTracker`
- ✅ Creates new markets when players cross threshold
- ✅ Updates existing markets' probabilities
- ✅ Handles both market creation and updates in one listener

**Key Logic:**
```javascript
// Check if market exists
const exists = await db.hasInfoFiMarket(seasonId, playerId, MARKET_TYPE);

if (!exists) {
  // Create new market
  const market = await db.createInfoFiMarket({...});
} else {
  // Update existing market probability
  await db.updateInfoFiMarketProbability(seasonId, playerId, MARKET_TYPE, winProbabilityBps);
}
```

#### New File: `backend/src/abis/RafflePositionTrackerAbi.js`
- ✅ Minimal ABI for `PositionSnapshot` event

#### `backend/src/config/chain.js`
- ✅ Added `positionTracker` alias for `raffleTracker` in both LOCAL and TESTNET configs

#### `backend/fastify/server.js`
- ✅ Import `startPositionTrackerListener`
- ✅ Start position tracker listener on backend startup
- ✅ Kept `startInfoFiMarketListener` for backward compatibility

### 3. Frontend Changes

**No changes needed!** 

The frontend already:
- ✅ Uses database as source of truth (`market.current_probability`)
- ✅ Removed oracle polling in previous fix
- ✅ Automatically shows updated odds when database is updated

## Gas Analysis

**Per buy/sell transaction:**
- Get participants array: ~2,100 gas
- Get season details: ~2,100 gas
- Per player (N players):
  - Read position: ~2,100 gas
  - Calculate BPS: ~100 gas
  - Emit event: ~1,500 gas
  - Update storage: ~5,000 gas (updates) or ~20,000 gas (first time)

**Total for 100 players:**
- Setup: ~4,200 gas
- Updates: ~8,700 gas × 100 = ~870,000 gas
- **Total: ~874,000 gas**

**With 250 player limit:**
- Max gas: ~2,175,000 gas (~2.2M gas)

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `updateAllPlayersInSeason()` with 0, 1, 10, 100, 250 players
- [ ] Test gas usage with different player counts
- [ ] Test that all players get `PositionSnapshot` events
- [ ] Test probabilities sum to 10000 bps (100%)

### Integration Tests
1. Deploy contracts with position tracker
2. Player 1 buys → verify 100% odds
3. Player 2 buys → verify both players' odds updated (66.7% / 33.3%)
4. Player 1 sells → verify both players' odds updated
5. Check database has correct probabilities
6. Check frontend displays correct odds

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy new contracts** (Anvil local testing)
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
   ```

2. **Update environment variables**
   ```bash
   node scripts/update-env-addresses.js
   node scripts/copy-abis.js
   ```

3. **Restart backend**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:backend
   ```

4. **Test the flow**
   - Buy tickets with Account 0
   - Buy tickets with Account 1
   - Verify both markets show correct odds in frontend

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert contract changes
2. Redeploy old contracts
3. Restart backend (will use old `InfoFiMarketListener`)
4. Frontend continues to work (no changes made)

## Benefits

1. ✅ **All players always up-to-date** - no stale odds
2. ✅ **Single source of truth** - `RafflePositionTracker` is canonical
3. ✅ **Cleaner architecture** - removed `InfoFiMarketFactory.updateProbability()`
4. ✅ **Gas efficient** - batch reads, single event per player
5. ✅ **No frontend changes** - already using database
6. ✅ **Backward compatible** - kept old listener running

## Known Limitations

1. **Gas cost**: ~870k gas for 100 players per transaction
2. **Player limit**: Capped at 250 players per update (configurable)
3. **User pays**: The player buying/selling pays for all updates

## Future Optimizations

1. **Batch events**: Emit single event with array of players
2. **Lazy updates**: Only update markets that exist (skip players without markets)
3. **Off-chain computation**: Move probability calculation to backend
4. **Incremental updates**: Update in batches across multiple blocks
