## Raffle Integration Details

### Code Added to Raffle.sol

```solidity
// In _setupPrizeDistribution() after winner selection
if (infoFiFactory != address(0)) {
    try IInfoFiMarketFactory(infoFiFactory).resolveSeasonMarkets(seasonId, grandWinner) {
        // Success - markets resolved
    } catch {
        // Log but don't revert raffle completion
        // InfoFi resolution failure shouldn't block prize distribution
    }
}
```

### Interface Update

```solidity
interface IInfoFiMarketFactory {
    function onPositionUpdate(...) external;
    function resolveSeasonMarkets(uint256 seasonId, address winner) external; // NEW
}
```

### Flow

```
VRF Callback → fulfillRandomWords()
  → _setupPrizeDistribution()
    → Select Winner
    → Resolve InfoFi Markets (try-catch)
    → Configure Prize Distributor
    → Extract Funds
    → Mark Complete
```

  const { infoFiFactory } = useContracts();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other season content */}
      
      <SeasonMarketsGrid
        seasonId={seasonId}
        factoryAddress={infoFiFactory}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```jsx
import { InfoFiTradingPanel } from '@/components/prediction/InfoFiTradingPanel';

function PlayerMarketPage({ csmmAddress, playerAddress, seasonId }) {
  return (
    <InfoFiTradingPanel
      csmmAddress={csmmAddress}
