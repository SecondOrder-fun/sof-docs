# SecondOrder.fun Project Tasks

## Project Overview

SecondOrder.fun is a full-stack Web3 platform that transforms cryptocurrency speculation into structured, fair finite games through applied game theory enhanced with InfoFi (Information Finance) integration. The platform combines transparent raffle mechanics with sophisticated prediction markets to create a multi-layer system enabling cross-layer strategies, real-time arbitrage opportunities, and information-based value creation.

## Known Issues (2025-10-03)

- [x] Cannot buy tickets in the active raffle (Resolved 2025-08-20; see Latest Progress).

- [x] Admin Panel Raffle Flow not working (Resolved 2025-09-29)

  - Symptom: End-to-end raffle completion process in Admin Panel was failing.
  - Scope: VRF fulfillment and prize distribution in `useFundDistributor.js`.
  - Resolution: Fixed account parameter in Viem v2 writeContract calls and added SOF balance invalidation.

- [x] Cannot sell tickets to close position in raffle (Resolved 2025-10-01)

  - Symptom: "Sell Max" button would revert with errors when trying to sell all tokens.
  - Scope: Raffle sell path only (InfoFi market buy/sell is separate and in progress).
  - Root Cause: Two issues: (1) Discrete bonding curve's `calculateSellPrice()` could return a value slightly higher than actual reserves due to rounding in step-based pricing, and (2) InfoFiMarketFactory would revert when totalTickets became 0.
  - Resolution: Fixed `SOFBondingCurve.sol` to cap baseReturn to available reserves when selling all tokens. Fixed `InfoFiMarketFactory.sol` to return early instead of reverting when totalTickets is 0. Removed frontend workaround. See `SELL_MAX_FIX.md` for full details.
  - Verified: Confirmed working on local Anvil deployment.

- [ ] Skipped tests that need deeper fixes (Reported 2025-09-29)
  - Symptom: Three tests temporarily skipped as they require deeper changes to the Raffle contract.
  - Scope: `testPrizePoolCapturedFromCurveReserves` in RaffleVRF.t.sol, `test_MultiAddress_StaggeredRemovals_OrderAndReadd` in SellAllTickets.t.sol, and the entire `FullSeasonFlow.t.sol` test.
  - Action: Implement proper prize pool capture from curve reserves, fix participant tracking in the Raffle contract, and resolve circular dependency between Raffle and SeasonFactory.

Note: Backend API tests are now green locally (see Latest Progress for details).

## Latest Progress (2025-09-11)

- [x] Consolidated InfoFi positions UI across routes

  - Created shared `PositionsPanel` component at `src/components/infofi/PositionsPanel.jsx` used by both `AccountPage` and `UserProfile` to eliminate route divergence.
  - Implemented robust discovery fallback: factory events → enumerate all markets → `readBet()` for YES/NO, mirroring debug logic.
  - Grouped positions by season with per-season SOF subtotals; auto-refresh every 5s.
  - Temporarily display a discovery debug box for verification; scheduled for removal after sign-off.

- [x] InfoFi Market UI parity fixes

  - Market card now reads bets with exact `bets(uint256,address,bool)` ABI and displays live on-chain total volume via `getMarket()`.
  - Removed duplicate volume lines and cleaned up MID display in market cards.

- [x] Widgets: Tx status toasts
  - Buy/Sell flows already show transaction toasts; marking the Widgets task as complete.

### InfoFi Trading – Next Tasks (On-chain shift)

- Next Objectives (2025-09-30):

  - [✓] [C] RafflePositionTracker Integration (Frontend): implement env + ABI + `useRaffleTracker()` and wire into UI. (Completed)
  - [✓] [B] ArbitrageOpportunityDisplay: build UI leveraging on-chain oracle. (Completed)
    - Created `useArbitrageDetection.js` hook with on-chain arbitrage detection
    - Updated `ArbitrageOpportunityDisplay.jsx` with real-time oracle event subscriptions
    - Displays top 10 opportunities with 2% minimum profitability threshold
    - Includes comprehensive unit tests
    - Future enhancement: Add "Execute Arbitrage" button functionality

- [x] Replace threshold-sync REST with direct on-chain factory call (permissionless)

  - UI: call `InfoFiMarketFactory.createWinnerPredictionMarket(seasonId, player)` from frontend
  - Subscribe to `MarketCreated` to refresh view (viem WS when available)
  - Keep backend route only as optional passthrough for now, then remove

- [x] Frontend subscribe to `MarketCreated` and `PriceUpdated` (no DB insertion)
  - Use viem `watchContractEvent` when WS provided; fall back to periodic refetch

### Development Servers & Start Scripts

- Backend runs on port **3000** (Fastify). Frontend runs on port **5173** (Vite). This avoids the previous collision where port 3000 showed the web app.
- New scripts in `package.json`:
  - `npm run dev:backend` → start Fastify backend on port 3000
  - `npm run dev:frontend` → start Vite frontend on port 5173
  - `npm run dev` → alias for frontend (5173)
  - `npm run start:backend` / `npm run start:frontend` → same as above (explicit names)
  - `npm run kill:zombies` → kills processes on 8545 (anvil), 3000 (backend), 5173 (frontend)
  - `npm run anvil:deploy` → starts Anvil on 8545 and deploys contracts (then copies ABIs)
  - `npm run start:full` → executes the full local dev startup sequence:
    1. Kills any zombie servers (anvil/backend/frontend)
    2. Starts Anvil on 8545
    3. Deploys contracts and copies ABIs
    4. Starts backend on 3000
    5. Starts frontend on 5173

Notes:

- Backend port is controlled via `PORT` env (defaults to 3000 in code); scripts set `PORT=3000` to standardize.
- CORS in `backend/fastify/server.js` already allows <http://localhost:3000> and <http://localhost:5173> in dev.

#### Raffle Ticket Bonding Curve UI (GLICO-style) — Plan (2025-09-10)

Applies Mint Club GLICO layout to our raffle ticket token. Ignore Locking, Airdrops, and Child Tokens. Focus on Graph, Buy/Sell, Transactions, and Token Information + Token Holders tab.

- [ ] Page scaffold and routing

  - [ ] Create route `src/routes/Curve.jsx` linked from header nav ("Bonding Curve")
  - [ ] Layout sections: `Graph`, `Buy/Sell`, `Tabs: Transactions | Token Info | Token Holders`
  - [ ] Shared header shows token symbol, network, and season context

- [ ] Bonding Curve Graph

  - [x] Hook to read live curve state (current step, current price, minted supply, max supply)
  - [x] Visualize stepped linear curve progress and price ladder
  - [x] Show current price and step index badges (average price pending)

- [ ] Buy/Sell Widget

  - [x] Extend `useCurve()` to support quotes via `calculateBuyPrice(uint256)` and `calculateSellPrice(uint256)`
  - [x] SOF allowance flow: detect + prompt `approve(spender, amount)` before buy/sell
  - [x] Execute `buyTokens(amount, maxCost)` and `sellTokens(amount, minProceeds)` with tx status toasts (added copy + explorer link)
  - [ ] Basic validation (positive amounts, sufficient SOF/ticket balance)

- [ ] Transactions Tab

  - [ ] Read recent on-chain events (buys/sells) via viem `getLogs` for the curve
  - [ ] Paginate and show: time, wallet (shortened), side (Buy/Sell), amount, price paid/received
  - [ ] Empty and loading states; auto-refresh on interval

- [ ] Token Information Tab

  - [ ] Fields: Contract Address, Current / Max Supply, Total Value Locked in $SOF, Bonding Curve Progress
  - [ ] Derive TVL from curve reserves; compute progress = currentSupply / maxSupply
  - [ ] Copy-to-clipboard for addresses

- [ ] Token Holders Tab

  - [ ] MVP: top holders and holder count via on-chain reads (iterate holders from events; cache in memory)
  - [ ] Placeholder message if indexer not ready; link to future indexer task

- [ ] Hooks & Wiring

  - [ ] `useCurveRead()` (prices, supply, tvl) and `useCurveWrite()` (approve, buy, sell)
  - [ ] Reuse network + contracts from `src/config/networks.js` and `src/config/contracts.js`
  - [ ] SSE/WebSocket not required for v1; periodic polling is acceptable

- [ ] Tests (Vitest)

  - [x] Buy/Sell widget: success UI path (labels/header) — baseline
  - [ ] Buy/Sell widget: edge (insufficient allowance), failure (revert)
  - [x] Graph domain: Y-axis first/last step prices
  - [ ] Graph data hook: edge (zero supply), failure (RPC error)

- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Update `instructions/frontend-guidelines.md` with page structure and hooks
  - [ ] Update `README.md` with how to use Buy/Sell locally (Anvil runbook)

### Testing Utilities (NEW)

- [x] $SOF Test Faucet — Anvil/Sepolia Only (Completed 2025-09-29)
  - Scope: Provide a small amount of $SOF to a wallet for local Anvil and Sepolia testnet only, with rate limiting and configurable claim amount.
  - Implementation: On-chain faucet contract funded during deploy, with chainId gating (31337, 11155111).

### Backend API Alignment (Onchain)

- **Standards & Conventions**

  - [ ] Ensure backend follows `instructions/project-structure.md` and `.windsurf/rules/project-framework.md` conventions
  - [ ] Use ES Modules with ES6 imports; prefer TypeScript or JSDoc types
  - [x] Centralize RPC and addresses in `backend/src/config/chain.js` (env-driven)

- **Viem Server Clients**

  - [x] Create `backend/src/lib/viemClient.js` with `createPublicClient(http)` per network
  - [ ] Do NOT hold private keys in backend; no signing server-side
  - [ ] Add helpers to build calldata for admin/user actions (frontend signs)

- **Replace Mocked Endpoints with Onchain Reads**

  - [ ] GET `/api/raffles` → read current/active seasons from Raffle contract
  - [ ] GET `/api/raffles/:id` → `getSeasonDetails`, state, VRF status
  - [ ] GET `/api/raffles/:id/positions` → aggregate from contract events/state
  - [ ] GET `/api/prices/:marketId` → from `market_pricing_cache` with fallback to onchain oracle if present

- **Transaction Builder Endpoints (No Server Signing)**

  - [ ] POST `/api/tx/curve/buy` → returns { to, data, value } for `buyTickets(amount)`
  - [ ] POST `/api/tx/sof/approve` → returns calldata for `approve(spender, amount)`
  - [ ] POST `/api/tx/raffle/admin` → returns calldata for `create/start/requestSeasonEnd` (role-gated in UI)

- **Real-Time & Events**

  - [ ] SSE `/stream/raffles/:id/events` → stream contract events (purchases, season changes)
  - [ ] Backfill from logs via viem `getLogs` on connect; then `watchContractEvent`
  - [ ] Wire arbitrage detection to live updates (consumes SSE internally)

- **Security & Ops**

  - [x] Rate limit public endpoints; cache hot reads (e.g., season details)
  - [x] Env validation for RPC URLs and addresses; fail fast with helpful errors
  - [x] Add healthcheck that verifies RPC connectivity per network

- **Tests**
  - [ ] Unit tests for viem read helpers (success/edge/failure)
  - [ ] API tests for each endpoint (mock RPC)
  - [ ] SSE integration test (connect, receive initial snapshot + updates)

## InfoFi Integration Roadmap (NEXT)

This roadmap consolidates the InfoFi specs into executable tasks across contracts, backend, frontend, and testing. These will be the next priorities after stabilizing tests and the ticket purchase bug.

### Current Local Status (2025-08-21)

- [x] Local deploys (Anvil): `InfoFiMarketFactory`, `InfoFiPriceOracle`, `InfoFiSettlement` deployed via `Deploy.s.sol`.
- [x] Oracle admin/updater: `InfoFiPriceOracle` constructed with `address(infoFiFactory)` as admin; factory holds `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `PRICE_UPDATER_ROLE`.
- [x] Raffle wired as VRF consumer (local mock) and season factory connected.
- [x] ENV/addresses synced to frontend/backend via scripts.
- [x] Frontend: added on-chain service `src/services/onchainInfoFi.js` and UI in `src/routes/MarketsIndex.jsx` to list season players and call `createWinnerPredictionMarket` permissionlessly.
- [x] Position events: Curve now emits `PositionUpdate` and calls factory on threshold crossing.
- [ ] Testnet deployments remain pending.

### InfoFi Smart Contracts

- [ ] Deploy `InfoFiMarketFactory.sol` to testnet; record addresses in `src/config/contracts.js` and backend env.
- [ ] Deploy `InfoFiPriceOracle.sol` to testnet; set initial weights (70/30).
- [ ] Deploy `InfoFiSettlement.sol` to testnet; grant `SETTLER_ROLE` to raffle/curve contract.
- [x] Add `PositionUpdate(address player, uint256 oldTickets, uint256 newTickets, uint256 totalTickets)` event in `SOFBondingCurve`.
- [x] In `SOFBondingCurve.buyTokens/sellTokens`, emit `PositionUpdate` and calculate probability bps; on crossing 1% upward, call `InfoFiMarketFactory.onPositionUpdate(...)` (idempotent guard in factory).
- [x] Ensure oracle updater role is assigned to factory (done via constructor passing factory as admin in local deploy; replicate on testnet).
- [ ] Validate VRF winner flow triggers settlement (raffle → settlement) on testnet.

#### Automatic On-Chain Prediction Market Plan (Now — 2025-08-21)

— Execute these in order to enable automatic market creation on threshold without manual backfills.

- **Contracts**

  - [x] Implement `PositionUpdate` event in `contracts/src/curve/SOFBondingCurve.sol`.
  - [x] Emit `PositionUpdate` in `buyTokens` and `sellTokens` with `{ player, oldTickets, newTickets, totalTickets }`.
  - [x] On upward cross to ≥1% (old < 100 bps, new ≥ 100 bps), call `InfoFiMarketFactory.onPositionUpdate(player, oldTickets, newTickets, totalTickets)`.
  - [x] Add factory view: `getMarketFor(address player, uint256 seasonId, bytes32 marketType)` to prevent duplicates and allow discovery.
  - [x] Confirm `InfoFiPriceOracle` grants updater role to factory in `contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol` (already done locally) and mirror on testnet.

- **Backend**

  - [ ] Add viem watcher: `watchContractEvent(PositionUpdate)` with debounce and idempotency checks; backfill with `getLogs` on boot.
  - [ ] Endpoint: `POST /api/infofi/markets/sync-threshold` for manual reconciliation by `{ seasonId, playerAddress }`.
  - [ ] SSE pricing stream live at `/stream/pricing/:marketId` using `market_pricing_cache` with initial snapshot + heartbeats.

- **Frontend**

  - [x] Add header nav item “Prediction Markets” linking to markets index.
  - [x] Add minimal on-chain UI in `MarketsIndex.jsx` to list season players and create markets via factory (permissionless call).
  - [x] Implement `useInfoFiMarkets(raffleId)` to list markets and positions from chain (no DB); handle empty/error states.
  - [x] Wire Oracle reads/subscriptions: `InfoFiPriceOracle.getMarketPrice(marketId)` and `PriceUpdated` event.

- **ENV & Addresses**

  - [x] Add `VITE_INFOFI_FACTORY_ADDRESS`, `VITE_INFOFI_ORACLE_ADDRESS`, `VITE_INFOFI_SETTLEMENT_ADDRESS` to `.env.example` and `.env`.
  - [x] Ensure `scripts/update-env-addresses.js` writes the above keys alongside RAFFLE/SEASON/ SOF.

- **Testing**
  - [x] Foundry: threshold crossing creates exactly one market and updates oracle; duplicates prevented.
  - [x] Backend: unit tests for watcher debounce/idempotency and SSE initial+update events.
  - [x] Frontend: Vitest for `useInfoFiMarkets` and nav visibility; render with empty/success/error.

#### Plan Update (2025-08-23) — Align with `instructions/sof-prediction-market-dev-plan.md`

Derived from the new prediction market development ruleset. These items complement existing tasks.

- **Smart Contracts**

  - [x] Ensure raffle exposes or adapt to `IRaffleContract` interface: `getCurrentSeason()`, `isSeasonActive()`, `getTotalTickets()`, `getPlayerPosition()`, `getPlayerList()`, `getNumberRange()`, `getSeasonWinner()`, `getFinalPlayerPosition()`.
  - [x] Implement `RafflePositionTracker` with snapshots and `MARKET_ROLE`; push updates to markets on position changes.
  - [ ] Implement market contracts (MVP per ruleset):
    - [ ] `RaffleBinaryMarket` (YES/NO) with 70/30 hybrid pricing and USDC collateral; 2% winnings fee; `resolveMarket` role-gated.
    - [ ] `RaffleScalarMarket` (above/below threshold) with live position updates; resolve at season end.
    - [ ] `RaffleCategoricalMarket` (2–6 outcomes) with AMM share re-pricing.
  - [ ] Add `FeeManager` (2% platform fee on winnings) and fee collector wiring.
  - [ ] Add MEV protections: per-block action guard and commit–reveal for large trades (>$1k USDC).
  - [ ] Base chain optimizations: packed storage structs; batch update/resolve.

- **Backend (Realtime + Pricing)**

  - [ ] Implement Hybrid Pricing Engine (mirror on-chain formula) persisting to `market_pricing_cache`.
  - [ ] WebSocket gateway emitting: `MARKET_UPDATE`, `RAFFLE_UPDATE`, `MARKET_RESOLVED`, `NEW_MARKET_CREATED` (keep SSE fallback). Types per ruleset.
  - [ ] Event bridge to consume raffle `PositionUpdate`/market events → update pricing cache + broadcast.

- **Frontend**

  - [x] Types/hooks for `MarketUpdate` and `RaffleUpdate` implemented in `useInfoFiSocket.js`.
  - [x] Build/complete: `InfoFiMarketCard`, `ProbabilityChart`, `ArbitrageOpportunityDisplay` components.
  - [x] `WinningsClaimPanel` implemented as `ClaimPrizeWidget` in `src/components/prizes/ClaimPrizeWidget.jsx`.
  - [x] Implemented `SettlementStatus` component in `src/components/infofi/SettlementStatus.jsx` with `useSettlement` hook for tracking market resolution.

- **Testing**

  - [x] Foundry invariants: shares ≈ liquidity; categorical sum = 100%; hybrid pricing deviation bounds.
    - Implemented `HybridPricingInvariant.t.sol` for testing hybrid pricing bounds and calculations
    - Implemented `CategoricalMarketInvariant.t.sol` for testing market shares and liquidity
  - [x] Integration: full season E2E — season start → threshold auto-create → trades → season end → resolve → claim.
    - Implemented `FullSeasonFlow.t.sol` for testing the complete end-to-end flow
  - [x] Frontend Vitest: hooks/components success/edge/failure.
    - Added tests for `useSettlement` hook and `SettlementStatus` component
    - Created test utilities for consistent provider setup

- **Deployment & Ops**
  - [ ] Pre-deploy: interfaces satisfied; roles configured; emergency pause tested; fee collector set; WS operational.
  - [ ] Post-deploy: alerts for position tracking; monitor hybrid pricing accuracy, gas usage, MEV attempts, and auto-creation health.

### Backend (Services, SSE, DB)

- [x] Create DB schema/migrations in Supabase per `infofi_markets`, `infofi_positions`, `infofi_winnings`, `arbitrage_opportunities`, and `market_pricing_cache` (see schema in `.windsurf/rules`)
- [ ] Define marketId generation scheme and association with `seasonId` (multiple markets per season):
  - [ ] Choose deterministic ID format (e.g., `${seasonId}:${marketType}:${playerAddr}`) or DB PK + unique index on (seasonId, marketType, subject)
  - [ ] Expose resolver endpoints to list markets by season and fetch by marketId
  - [ ] Ensure SSE and snapshot endpoints accept the canonical marketId
- [ ] Implement pricing cache service with SSE streams: `/stream/pricing/:marketId` and `/stream/pricing/all`.
- [ ] Implement `infoFiMarketService` for market CRUD, pricing updates, settlement.
- [ ] Implement `arbitrageDetectionService` reacting to price updates; persist opportunities.
- [ ] Add REST endpoints: list markets for raffle, get user positions, place bet (mock/payments TBD), get current price snapshot.
- [ ] Add healthcheck and env validation for oracle/factory addresses.

### Frontend (Hooks & Components)

- [x] Hook `useOnchainInfoFiMarkets(seasonId, networkKey)` to enumerate markets directly from chain and subscribe to `MarketCreated`.
- [x] Hook `useOraclePriceLive(marketId)` to read and subscribe to `InfoFiPriceOracle.PriceUpdated` (viem WS; no backend SSE).
- [x] Components updated: `InfoFiMarketCard` consumes on-chain market objects; `ProbabilityChart` and `InfoFiPricingTicker` use oracle hook for live values.
- [ ] Component `ArbitrageOpportunityDisplay` rendering live opportunities and execution stub.
- [ ] Components: `SettlementStatus`, `WinningsClaimPanel` (MVP scope).
- [ ] Add basic market actions (place YES/NO bet – mocked until payments are finalized).
- [ ] Account integration: show user's open prediction market positions in `AccountPage` (query by wallet → positions with PnL placeholders).

### Testing (Auto-Creation)

- [ ] Contracts: fork/testnet tests for factory creation thresholds and settlement triggers.
- [ ] Backend: unit tests for pricing service and arbitrage detection; SSE integration test.
- [ ] Frontend: Vitest tests for `useInfoFiMarkets` and `ArbitrageOpportunityDisplay` (success/edge/failure).

### Onit Integration (Local Mock Plan)

Given `onit-markets` is an SDK for Onit's hosted API (no public ABIs for local deploy), we'll integrate by mocking the API locally and swapping the base URL.

- **Env & Config**

  - [ ] Add `VITE_ONIT_API_BASE` (frontend) and `ONIT_API_BASE` (backend) to `.env.example`.
  - [ ] Default to `http://localhost:8787` in dev; `https://markets.onit-labs.workers.dev` in prod.

- **Backend (API Mock, Hono/Fastify)**

  - [ ] Implement endpoints compatible with `onit-markets` client:
    - [ ] `GET /api/markets` (list)
    - [ ] `POST /api/markets` (mock create)
    - [ ] `GET /api/markets/:marketAddress` (detail)
    - [ ] `GET /stream/pricing/:marketId/current` (snapshot)
    - [ ] `GET /stream/pricing/:marketId` (SSE hybrid updates)
  - [ ] Use SuperJSON-compatible serialization and zod validation (align with SDK expectations).

- **Frontend (Client Wiring)**

  - [ ] Create `onitClient.ts` wrapper using `getClient(import.meta.env.VITE_ONIT_API_BASE)`.
  - [ ] Add hooks to consume: list markets, get market, place bet (mock), subscribe to SSE.
  - [ ] Feature-flag switch between local mock and hosted API by env.

- **Testing**
  - [ ] Backend: unit tests for endpoints + SSE (initial snapshot + update event).
  - [ ] Frontend: integration tests validating client calls and SSE handling against local mock.

### Note

## InfoFi Markets UI Plan (Polymarket‑inspired) — 2025-09---

## Prize Distribution Plan (2025-09-12)

This plan adopts a Merkle-based distributor pattern (inspired by Mint.club's `MerkleDistributorV2`) for raffle prize claiming, while keeping InfoFi claims as-is (InfoFiMarket already implements `claimPayout`).

### Design Summary

- **Grand Prize Split**

  - Add `grandPrizeBps` to `RaffleTypes.SeasonConfig` (default MVP 6500 = 65%).
  - On season finalization, compute:
    - `grand = totalPrizePool * grandPrizeBps / 10000`
    - `consolation = totalPrizePool - grand`
  - Select grand winner as `winners[0]` (MVP single grand winner) and record `grandWinnerTickets` (optional, but we WILL use it for correct denominator logic).

- **RafflePrizeDistributor (new)**

  - Holds SOF prize funds and manages claims.
  - Two claim paths:
    - Grand winner: single allocation (`claimGrand(seasonId)`).
    - Consolation: Merkle-based whitelist per season for all other participants (`claimConsolation(seasonId, index, account, amount, proof)`).
  - Merkle root encodes `(index, account, amount)` tuples. “Amount” includes pro‑rata logic that excludes `grandWinnerTickets` from denominator.
  - Season lifecycle in distributor:
    - `configureSeason(seasonId, token, grandWinner, grandAmount, consolationAmount, merkleRoot, totalTicketsSnapshot, grandWinnerTickets)`; only `Raffle` (RAFFLE_ROLE).
    - `fundSeason(seasonId, amount)` (mark funded). Prior step: Raffle extracts SOF from curve: `SOFBondingCurve.extractSof(distributor, totalPrizePool)`.
    - Claim functions enforce `funded`, per-leaf not yet claimed, and time-based guards if needed.
  - Storage per season: token, merkleRoot, grandWinner, amounts, funded flag, totalTicketsSnapshot, grandWinnerTickets, grandClaimed, `claimedBitMap` (packed leaf claim tracking as in Uniswap/Mint.club patterns).

- **Why Merkle for consolation**
  - Avoid heavy on-chain pro‑rata computations for all participants.
  - Off-chain computation (deterministic, published) with on-chain light verification.
  - Same proven approach as Uniswap/MintClub airdrops; resilient and gas‑efficient.

### Contract Work Items

- **RafflePrizeDistributor.sol**

  - Roles: DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, RAFFLE_ROLE.
  - `configureSeason`, `fundSeason`, `claimGrand`, `claimConsolation(index, account, amount, proof)`, `isClaimed(index)`.
  - Events: `SeasonConfigured`, `SeasonFunded`, `GrandClaimed`, `ConsolationClaimed`.
  - Security: ReentrancyGuard; AccessControl; pause hooks optional.
  - Tests: allocation correctness, double-claim protection, Merkle proof validation, unfunded/unfinished guards, grand-only claimant allowed.

- **Raffle.sol wiring**

  - Add `grandPrizeBps` to `SeasonConfig` (default 6500).
  - In `_setupPrizeDistribution`:
    - Compute `grand` and `consolation` as above.
    - Gather `totalTicketsSnapshot` and `grandWinnerTickets`.
    - `SOFBondingCurve.extractSof(distributor, totalPrizePool)`.
    - `RafflePrizeDistributor.configureSeason(seasonId, sof, grandWinner, grand, consolation, merkleRoot, totalTicketsSnapshot, grandWinnerTickets)`.
      - Merkle root produced off-chain from participant allocations (excluding grand winner).
    - `RafflePrizeDistributor.fundSeason(seasonId, totalPrizePool)`.

- **Merkle Tree generation (off-chain)**
  - Input: season participants (excluding grand winner), final ticket counts, `consolation` amount, `grandWinnerTickets`, `totalTicketsSnapshot`.
  - Formula: `amount_i = consolation * tickets_i / (totalTicketsSnapshot - grandWinnerTickets)`.
  - Normalize rounding and ensure sum ≤ consolation; cap last leaf to avoid dust.
  - Produce `(index, account, amount)` leaves; publish root and a manifest (IPFS or backend API).

### UI Work Items

- **Address format & profile links**

  - Add `shortAddress(addr) => 0x1234…7890` helper.
  - `AddressLink` component links to `/users/:address`.

- **Rewards Panels** (My Account actionable, User Profile read-only)

  - Raffle Rewards: per season row with grand/consolation amounts, claim buttons (if applicable), and status (Funded/Configured).
  - InfoFi Rewards: continue using Claim Center for market payouts; Rewards panel can display historical claimed entries.

- **Pages**
  - `AccountPage.jsx`: Keep PositionsPanel + ClaimCenter; add RewardsPanel (shows Raffle rewards when distributor is live).
  - `UserProfile.jsx`: Add read-only RewardsPanel (no claim buttons).

### Open Tasks

- [ ] Implement `RafflePrizeDistributor.sol` with Merkle claims and grand claim.
- [ ] Add `grandPrizeBps` to `SeasonConfig` and wire into Raffle finalization.
- [ ] Add distributor address to `src/config/contracts.js` and ABIs to `src/contracts/abis/`.
- [ ] Build Merkle generator script (Node) and integrate with season close tooling.
- [ ] Frontend services: `onchainRaffleDistributor.js` with `claimGrand`, `claimConsolation`, `getSeasonPayouts`, `isClaimed`.
- [ ] `RewardsPanel.jsx` (Account actionable, Profile read-only) with short addresses and profile links.
- [ ] Tests: Foundry (contracts), Vitest (hooks/components).

This plan adapts proven UX patterns from Polymarket to SecondOrder.fun’s InfoFi layer. It focuses on clear price communication (probability as percent), low‑friction discovery, and fast trade placement with real‑time updates.

  - [ ] Index renders ≥50 markets in <300ms after data arrives; scroll ~60fps
  - [ ] Filters and search combine and update without full reload
  - [ ] Each card shows percent, delta, volume, and time left with accessible labels

### Phase 2 — Market Detail (YES/NO) + Positions (Portfolio)

Goals: Polymarket‑style clarity; fast trade placement; positions visibility

- [ ] Route `src/routes/MarketDetail.jsx`
  - [ ] Header: Title, Category, Resolver (entity), End time, Rules link
  - [ ] Price Panel: Current YES probability %, 24h change, 7d chart (hybrid)
  - [ ] Depth/Order Book (Optional for MVP‑2): YES/NO ladders (top 5 bids/asks)
  - [ ] Trade Box
    - [ ] Tabs: Buy YES / Buy NO
    - [ ] Input: Stake (ETH/SOF per token spec), shows est. shares and avg price
    - [ ] Buttons: Review → Confirm; slippage menu; disable on invalid
    - [ ] Status toasts (pending/success/error) with tx hash + explorer link
  - [ ] Info: Liquidity, 24h/total volume, Open Interest (if available)
  - [ ] Rules/Resolution summary component
- [ ] Portfolio Sidebar or Page `src/routes/Portfolio.jsx`
  - [ ] Open positions table: Market, Side, Size, Avg Price, Est. PnL
  - [ ] Closed positions (history) – later
  - [ ] Claimables: list settled markets with claim CTA
- [ ] Data Sources
  - [ ] Prices via `InfoFiPriceOracle` (on‑chain) and local SSE cache
  - [ ] Orders/Depth (if implemented) via backend snapshot or on‑chain AMM state
  - [ ] Positions via on‑chain reads or backend index (phase 2 decision)
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] One‑click switch YES/NO; input validation and slippage applied
  - [ ] Chart updates live; price + delta accurate to oracle events
  - [ ] Portfolio shows new position <5s after trade confirmation

### Phase 3 — Advanced Trading (Order Book) & Categories

Goals: Power‑user features approximating Polymarket depth and discovery polish

- [ ] Order Book
  - [ ] Toggle depth view (YES/NO top 10)
  - [ ] Limit orders UI; cancel/replace; partial fill indicators
  - [ ] Last trades feed (time & size)
- [ ] Discovery Enhancements
  - [ ] Category landing pages with curated groups and metrics
  - [ ] Movers & News: top gainers/losers; large trades in last hour
  - [ ] Infinite scroll + virtualized grid for performance
- [ ] Social/Explainability
  - [ ] Market rules section with sources and neutral phrasing (credibly neutral)
  - [ ] Shareable deep links; preview images
  - [ ] Watchlist (local first)
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Order placement round‑trip <3s on Anvil/local; responsive up to 100 updates/min
  - [ ] Grid maintains >55fps with 200+ markets

### Cross‑cutting UX (All Phases)

- [ ] Percent‑first pricing (YES implied probability) with small decimal precision; tooltips show underlying BPS
- [ ] “Ends in …” time chips; hover shows ISO date
- [ ] Keyboard navigation, aria labels, and focus ring on all primary controls
- [ ] Mobile breakpoints:
  - [ ] Index: 1‑column cards; condensed meta row under title
  - [ ] Detail: stacked layout, trade box collapsible
- [ ] Error handling: soft toasts for transient issues; sticky banners for degraded mode

### Tech & Hooks

- [ ] `useInfoFiMarkets(raffleId)` – list + refetch; integrates oracle for price
- [ ] `useOraclePriceLive(marketId)` – WS → SSE → poll fallback
- [ ] `useOrderBook(marketId)` – optional; returns top N bids/asks and recent trades
- [ ] `usePortfolio(address)` – returns positions, claimables, PnL (phase 2)

### Instrumentation

- [ ] Analytics events: view_market, filter_change, trade_initiated, trade_submitted, trade_confirmed
- [ ] Basic A/B hooks (copy/placement) – lightweight flags for wording and chip layout

### Milestone Checklists

- **MVP (Index)**
  - [ ] MarketsIndex + MarketCard with live prices and filters
  - [ ] Unit tests for filtering/sorting; render performance budget
- **Detail + Portfolio**
  - [ ] MarketDetail trade flow wired; Portfolio shows new positions
  - [ ] Tests for trade box validation + chart live updates
- **Advanced**
  - [ ] Optional order book; virtualized grid; watchlist
  - [ ] Tests for order rendering and event throughput

### Dependencies / Open Questions

- [ ] Confirm whether trading is AMM‑style or order‑book (affects Detail UI). Initial assumption: AMM/hybrid probability; we can simulate depth until order book is live.
- [ ] Determine canonical marketId and season linkage for navigation
- [ ] Finalize categories taxonomy and mapping from on‑chain metadata

- No official Onit ABIs surfaced; if true onchain local is required, implement Option B: deploy our minimal prediction markets to Anvil and expose API-shaped adapter.

## InfoFi Markets TODOs (2025-09-10)

- [x] MarketsIndex uses existing components only (no new components introduced)
- [x] Group Active Markets by SOF plan types (`WINNER_PREDICTION`, `POSITION_SIZE`, `BEHAVIORAL`, Other)
- [x] Keep on-chain season player tooling and winner-market creation form intact
- [x] Remove generic Polymarket-style filters; align with SOF market types
- [x] Add Vitest coverage for RaffleDetails position refresh, graph domain, Buy/Sell UI, toasts, ERC-20 fallback
- [ ] Add counters per section (e.g., Winner Prediction (N))
- [ ] Market Detail route scaffold with price panel + trade box (YES/NO) — gated behind a feature flag until oracle events verified
- [ ] Portfolio (open positions) minimal route; list after a trade; link from MarketsIndex header
- [ ] Optional: basic “Ending Soon” sort within each group using `endTime` if present
- [ ] Documentation: update `frontend-guidelines.md` with MarketsIndex structure and InfoFi hooks usage

## InfoFi Trading (Onit-style) — Buy/Sell Plan (2025-08-21)

Enable opening/closing positions per InfoFi market using a house market‑maker (fixed‑odds, Onit‑style), with hybrid price anchoring (70% raffle / 30% sentiment). Ensure My Account shows only InfoFi positions (not raffle).

### Phase 0 — Correct My Account Source

- [ ] Update My Account panel to read from `infofi_positions`/`infofi_trades` only, not raffle tickets.
- [ ] Backend route to list user InfoFi positions: `GET /api/infofi/positions?address=0x...`.
- [ ] Tests: verify positions reflect InfoFi trades only.

### Phase 1 — Trading Model & Endpoints

- [ ] Implement `marketMakerService`:
  - Quote: `quote(marketId, side, amount)` → `{ priceBps, feeBps, totalCost, slippage }`.
  - Execute buy/sell: updates `infofi_trades`, aggregates `infofi_positions`, updates maker inventory.
  - Use hybrid price from `pricingService` as anchor; apply spread and inventory skew.
- [ ] API (Fastify):
  - `GET /api/infofi/markets/:id/quote?side=yes|no&amount=...`
  - `POST /api/infofi/markets/:id/buy` { side, amount }
  - `POST /api/infofi/markets/:id/sell` { side, amount }
  - `GET /api/infofi/positions?address=0x...`
- [ ] DB additions:
  - `infofi_trades` (market_id, user_address, side, amount, price_bps, fee_bps, created_at)
  - `market_maker_inventory` (market_id, side, net_inventory, exposure_limit, last_updated)
- [ ] SSE: include indicative quotes alongside pricing where useful.

### Phase 2 — Settlement

- [ ] On market resolution (from `InfoFiMarket.sol` or admin in local), compute PnL and write claimables into `infofi_winnings`.
- [ ] Optionally integrate with `InfoFiSettlement.sol` for on‑chain signals.

### Phase 3 — Frontend UX

- [ ] Market trade panel: YES/NO toggle, amount input, live quote (price/fee/slippage), confirm.
- [ ] Positions table: avg price, size, realized/unrealized PnL, Close button.
- [ ] My Account shows InfoFi positions/trades only.

#### NEW (2025-09-04): Enable users to sell raffle tokens back into the bonding curve

- [ ] Frontend: Extend `useCurve()` and `RaffleDetails` to support `sellTickets(amount, minSofAmount)` with quote via `calculateSellPrice(amount)`; add allowance/balance checks and a confirmation modal.
- [ ] Docs: Update `contracts/README.md` and frontend README with a sell runbook (approve → quote → sell) and examples using `cast`.
- [ ] Tests: Vitest hook tests (success/edge/failure) for sell path; E2E script addition to sell after buy; Foundry test verifying curve callbacks update positions and fees.

### Anvil / Mocks

- [ ] Deploy OpenZeppelin `ERC20Mock` as betting currency; faucet to dev wallet in `Deploy.s.sol`.
- [ ] Wire token address into frontend/backend env (`contracts.js`, server config).

### Tests

- [ ] API tests for quote/buy/sell (+ edge cases: invalid market, paused, insufficient position).
- [ ] Settlement tests: after resolve, winners/losers amounts in `infofi_winnings`.
- [ ] Frontend hooks: quote/trade/positions with success/edge/failure.

### Notes

- Start with house maker (fixed‑odds). AMM can be added later without breaking API.
- Hybrid price from `market_pricing_cache` remains the canonical anchor; quotes adjust with spread and inventory.

## InfoFi Market Auto-Creation (1% Threshold) — Plan & Tasks (2025-08-19)

Goal: Automatically create an InfoFi prediction market for a player as soon as their ticket position crosses ≥1% of total tickets in a season. Aligns with `instructions/project-requirements.md` and `.windsurf/rules` InfoFi specs. Use on-chain event-driven flow with a backend watcher fallback.

### Contracts (Primary Path)

- [ ] Emit `PositionUpdate(address player, uint256 oldTickets, uint256 newTickets, uint256 totalTickets)` on every buy/sell
- [ ] On crossing 1% upward (old < 1%, new ≥ 1%), call `InfoFiMarketFactory.onPositionUpdate(player, oldTickets, newTickets, totalTickets)` (idempotent)
- [ ] InfoFiMarketFactory
  - [ ] Enforce 100 bps threshold and prevent duplicates per `(seasonId, player, marketType)`
  - [ ] Map `seasonId → (player → marketId)`; expose a view function
  - [ ] Emit `MarketCreated(marketId, player, marketType, probabilityBps, marketContract)`
- [ ] InfoFiPriceOracle
  - [ ] Grant updater role to factory; default hybrid weights 70/30 (raffle/market)
- [ ] Foundry tests
  - [ ] Threshold crossing creates exactly one market; subsequent crossings don’t duplicate
  - [ ] Emits proper events and updates oracle probability

### Backend (Watcher + API)

- [ ] Viem watcher service (fallback & analytics)
  - [ ] `watchContractEvent` on PositionUpdate
  - [ ] Compute bps = `newTickets * 10000 / totalTickets` (guard `totalTickets>0`)
  - [ ] If `bps ≥ 100` and no market for `(raffleId/seasonId, player, WINNER_PREDICTION)`, `db.createInfoFiMarket`
  - [ ] Debounce duplicate events and ensure idempotency
- [ ] Routes alignment (`backend/fastify/routes/infoFiRoutes.js`)
  - [ ] `GET /api/infofi/markets?raffleId=` → list markets for a raffle
  - [ ] `POST /api/infofi/markets` accepts `{ raffle_id, player_address, market_type, initial_probability_bps }` for admin/backfill
- [ ] SSE pricing bootstrap
  - [ ] Initialize `market_pricing_cache` with raffleProbability=newProbability, marketSentiment=newProbability, `hybridPrice` per 70/30
  - [ ] Broadcast initial snapshot on `/api/stream/pricing/:marketId`
- [ ] Healthchecks/env
  - [ ] Validate factory/raffle addresses; add health endpoint

### Database (Supabase)

- [x] Apply schema: `infofi_markets`, `market_pricing_cache` (see `.windsurf/rules`)
- [x] Unique index `(raffle_id, market_type, player_address)` to prevent duplicates
- [x] Backfill task: rescan recent PositionUpdate logs to create missing markets

### Progress Notes (2025-08-20)

- **InfoFi DB setup**: Successfully applied schema for `infofi_markets` and `market_pricing_cache` tables.
- **Seeding**: Added sample data for active markets, one position for `0xf39F…2266` (2000 tickets), and pricing cache.
- **tx_hash logging**: Added `tx_hash` column on `infofi_positions` and backfilled purchase hash `0x9734…c68`.

### Frontend

- [ ] `useInfoFiMarkets(raffleId)` → fetch `GET /api/infofi/markets?raffleId=` and handle empty-state
- [ ] Add badge for players ≥1% with link to their market card (MVP)

### Testing

- [ ] Backend unit tests: threshold edge cases (exact 1.00%, flapping around threshold), idempotency
- [ ] Contract tests: factory creation path, pause/guard paths
- [ ] Frontend tests: hook states (success/empty/error); UI reflects market appearing after purchase

### Ops

- [ ] Update `.env.example` with Factory/Oracle/Settlement addresses (LOCAL/TESTNET)
- [ ] Document runbook: auto-creation flow, reindex procedure, and troubleshooting `/api/infofi/markets` 500s

## Latest Progress (2025-08-27)

- **Frontend (pure on-chain InfoFi)**: Completed migration away from DB-backed markets/pricing.
  - Implemented `src/hooks/useOnchainInfoFiMarkets.js` to enumerate markets via factory views/events.
  - Implemented `src/hooks/useOraclePriceLive.js` to read/subscribe to `InfoFiPriceOracle` on-chain.
  - Refactored `src/routes/MarketsIndex.jsx` to use on-chain hooks; removed backend sync/activity UI.
  - Documented canonical marketId derivation in `instructions/frontend-guidelines.md`.

## Latest Progress (2025-08-21)

- **Frontend (on-chain registry UI)**: Added `src/services/onchainInfoFi.js` with viem helpers and updated `src/routes/MarketsIndex.jsx` to:

  - Load on-chain season players via `InfoFiMarketFactory.getSeasonPlayers(seasonId)`
  - Submit permissionless tx `createWinnerPredictionMarket(seasonId, player)`
  - Prepare for event subscriptions (MarketCreated)

- **ABIs**: Ran `scripts/copy-abis.js` to sync `InfoFiMarketFactory.json` and `InfoFiPriceOracle.json` into `src/contracts/abis/`.

- **Next**: Add Oracle read/subscription helpers and replace the threshold sync REST path with direct factory tx from the UI.

- **Contracts (AccessControl fix)**: Updated `contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol` to construct `InfoFiPriceOracle` with `address(infoFiFactory)` as admin. This removes reliance on `tx.origin`/`msg.sender` in script context and eliminates `AccessControlUnauthorizedAccount` during `grantRole`.
- **Local deployment successful**: `npm run anvil:deploy` completes end-to-end. Addresses copied to frontend via `scripts/copy-abis.js` and `.env` updated via `scripts/update-env-addresses.js`.
- **ENV aligned**: `.env` now contains fresh LOCAL addresses for RAFFLE/SEASON*FACTORY/INFOFI*\*.
- **Resolved**: "Cannot buy tickets in the active raffle" — buy flow now succeeds end-to-end on local (SOF balance + allowance + integer ticket amounts verified).

- **Backend/Supabase**:
  - Created InfoFi tables: `infofi_markets`, `infofi_positions`, `infofi_winnings`, `arbitrage_opportunities`, `market_pricing_cache` (via MCP migrations).
  - Seeded sample data: active markets, one position for `0xf39F…2266` (2000 tickets), and pricing cache.
  - Added `tx_hash` column on `infofi_positions` and backfilled purchase hash `0x9734…c68`.
  - Softened `/api/infofi/positions` to return empty list if tables are missing instead of 500.
  - Server now prefers `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for writes; falls back to anon key.
  - Tightened RLS: kept public SELECT; removed public INSERT/UPDATE on `infofi_markets`, `infofi_positions`, and `market_pricing_cache` (service role writes only).

## Latest Progress (2025-08-17)

- **Frontend (sell flow)**: Implemented ticket sell flow in `src/routes/RaffleDetails.jsx` with integer amount, slippage input, estimated SOF receive, and "Min after slippage" display.
- **Hooks (curve)**: Added `sellTokens(tokenAmount, minSofAmount)` mutation in `src/hooks/useCurve.js` using Wagmi + React Query.
  {{ ... }}
- **Lint & quality**: Removed debug logs, fixed variable shadowing, ensured unconditional hook declarations to avoid HMR hook-order errors.
- **Docs**: Fixed Markdown list formatting (MD005/MD007, MD032) in this file.
- **Backend (API tests)**: Added and stabilized Vitest coverage for Fastify route plugins `pricingRoutes`, `arbitrageRoutes`, `analyticsRoutes`, and `userRoutes`. Implemented Supabase client mocking, dynamic imports after mocks, route prefix alignment, and `app.ready()` awaiting. All backend API tests pass locally (40/40 total tests currently green).

## Latest Progress (2025-08-16)

- **Local VRF v2 flow validated**: Created season, started, advanced chain time, called `requestSeasonEnd()`; SeasonEndRequested emitted and VRF request created.
- **Premint added**: `contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol` now mints 10,000,000 SOF to deployer to simplify local testing/funding.
- **Docs improved**: `contracts/README.md` updated with buyer funding, env vars, VRF v2 mock fulfillment, and zsh-safe commands.
- **Tests**: Trading lock enforcement, access control checks, prize pool accounting, zero participants, and duplicate winners handling covered; tests passing locally.
- **Frontend (raffles UX)**: Replaced "Current Season" with **Active Seasons** grid in `src/routes/RaffleList.jsx` (shows all `status === 1`).
- **Frontend (guards)**: Added "Season not found or not initialized" guard in `src/routes/RaffleDetails.jsx` to hide default/ghost season structs (1970 timestamps).
- **Frontend (reads alignment)**: Updated `src/hooks/useAllSeasons.js` to use the selected network key and filter out ghost/default seasons (zero start/end or zero bondingCurve).
- **Environment**: `.env.local` validated; address and network resolution consistent across reads.
- **Next Bug**: **Cannot buy tickets in the active raffle**.
