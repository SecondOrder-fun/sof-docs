# $SOF Transaction History - Final Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Complete

Successfully implemented comprehensive $SOF transaction history for the User Profile page with smart categorization and chunked queries.

## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Smart Transaction Categorization

**Distinguishes between:**
- **Purchase** - $SOF sent to bonding curve contracts (buying raffle tickets)
- **Sent** - $SOF transferred to other wallet addresses
- **Received** - Incoming $SOF transfers
- **Buy/Sell** - Bonding curve trades (from TokensPurchased/TokensSold events)
- **Grand Prize** - Prize claims from winning raffles
- **Consolation** - Consolation prize claims
- **Fees** - Platform fees collected (admin/treasury)

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Chunked block range queries** via `queryLogsInChunks` utility
- Prevents RPC timeouts on networks with large block ranges
- Default chunk size: 10,000 blocks with automatic fallback
- Configurable lookback period: 500,000 blocks (~11.5 days on Base, ~57 days on Ethereum)

### 3. User Interface

**Summary Statistics:**
- Total Received (green)
- Total Sent (red)
- Net Flow (green/red based on value)
- Total Transactions count

**Filtering:**
- All transactions
- Received only
- Sent only
- Trades (buy/sell)
- Prizes (grand/consolation)

**Display Features:**
- Color-coded amounts (green IN, red OUT)
- Transaction type badges
- Detailed descriptions
- Block explorer links
- Timestamp formatting
- Pagination (20 items per page)
- Responsive design

### 4. Real-Time Updates

- Auto-refetch every 60 seconds
- 30-second stale time
- React Query caching

## Files Created

### Core Implementation
- `src/hooks/useSOFTransactions.js` - Transaction fetching hook with chunked queries
- `src/components/user/SOFTransactionHistory.jsx` - UI component
- `tests/hooks/useSOFTransactions.test.jsx` - Unit tests (4/4 passing)

### Documentation
- `SOF_TRANSACTION_HISTORY_SUMMARY.md` - Initial implementation summary
- `SOF_TRANSACTION_HISTORY_FINAL.md` - Final summary (this file)

### Updates
- `src/routes/UserProfile.jsx` - Integrated component
- `public/locales/en/account.json` - Added translations
- `instructions/project-tasks.md` - Marked task complete

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Missing contract address in bonding curve query
**Issue:** Bonding curve buy events query had no `address` parameter  
**Fix:** Added `address: contracts.SOFBondingCurve` at line 110

### Bug #2: Missing fromBlock in outgoing transfers
**Issue:** Outgoing Transfer events query missing `fromBlock` parameter  
**Fix:** Added `fromBlock` parameter at line 67

## Transaction Types Tracked

### From Transfer Events
1. **TRANSFER_IN** - Incoming $SOF transfers
2. **TRANSFER_OUT** - Outgoing $SOF to regular addresses
3. **BONDING_CURVE_PURCHASE** - Outgoing $SOF to bonding curve (smart categorization)

### From Bonding Curve Events
4. **BONDING_CURVE_BUY** - TokensPurchased events
5. **BONDING_CURVE_SELL** - TokensSold events

### From Prize Distributor Events
6. **PRIZE_CLAIM_GRAND** - GrandPrizeClaimed events
7. **PRIZE_CLAIM_CONSOLATION** - ConsolationClaimed events

### From Fee Collection Events
8. **FEE_COLLECTED** - FeesCollected events (admin/treasury)

## Smart Categorization Logic

```javascript
// Outgoing transfers are categorized based on recipient
const bondingCurveAddresses = [contracts.SOFBondingCurve?.toLowerCase()];

for (const transfer of outgoingTransfers) {
  if (bondingCurveAddresses.includes(transfer.to?.toLowerCase())) {
    // Mark as BONDING_CURVE_PURCHASE
    transactions.push({
      ...transfer,
      type: 'BONDING_CURVE_PURCHASE',
      description: 'Purchased raffle tickets',
    });
  } else {
    // Regular transfer to another address
    transactions.push(transfer);
  }
}
```

## Testing

All tests passing:
```
✓ should fetch and categorize transactions correctly
✓ should handle empty transaction history
✓ should not fetch when address is not provided
✓ should respect enabled option
```

## Integration

The component is integrated into `UserProfile.jsx`:
- Positioned below $SOF balance card
- Above raffle holdings section
- Works for both own account and viewing other users
- Full i18n support

## Usage

```jsx
import { SOFTransactionHistory } from '@/components/user/SOFTransactionHistory';

// Basic usage
<SOFTransactionHistory address={userAddress} />

// With custom lookback period
<SOFTransactionHistory 
  address={userAddress} 
  options={{ lookbackBlocks: 100000n }} 
/>
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Initial load:** Fetches up to 500k blocks of history
- **Chunked queries:** 10k blocks per chunk (prevents timeouts)
- **Parallel fetching:** All event types fetched simultaneously
- **Caching:** React Query with 30s stale time
- **Auto-refresh:** Every 60 seconds
- **Pagination:** 20 items per page for optimal rendering

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Indexer integration for faster historical data
- Virtual scrolling for very large datasets
- Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- Advanced filtering (date ranges, amount ranges)
- Search by transaction hash or address
- Transaction grouping by day/week/month

## Conclusion

The $SOF Transaction History feature provides complete visibility into user token activity across all platform interactions. The smart categorization distinguishes between purchases and transfers, while chunked queries ensure reliable performance on all networks. The feature is production-ready and fully tested.
