# FPMM Implementation: Phase 4 Complete ✅

## Summary

Phase 4 (Settlement & Redemption) is now complete! Users can now redeem their conditional tokens after markets are resolved, converting winning positions back to SOF collateral.

---

## ✅ Changes Made in Phase 4

### 1. RaffleOracleAdapter - Already Implemented! ✅

**File**: `contracts/src/infofi/RaffleOracleAdapter.sol`

The `batchResolveSeasonMarkets()` function was already implemented in the contract:

```solidity
function batchResolveSeasonMarkets(
    uint256 seasonId,
    address[] calldata players,
    address winner
) external onlyRole(RESOLVER_ROLE) {
    require(winner != address(0), "Winner zero address");
    require(players.length > 0, "Empty players array");
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
        address player = players[i];
        
        // Skip if not prepared or already resolved
        bytes32 conditionId = playerConditions[seasonId][player];
        if (conditionId == bytes32(0)) continue;
        if (resolved[conditionId]) continue;
        
        // Determine outcome
        bool playerWon = (player == winner);
        
        // Payout vector: [WIN, LOSE]
        uint256[] memory payouts = new uint256[](2);
        if (playerWon) {
            payouts[0] = 1; // WIN gets 1
            payouts[1] = 0; // LOSE gets 0
        } else {
            payouts[0] = 0; // WIN gets 0
            payouts[1] = 1; // LOSE gets 1
        }
        
        // Report payouts to ConditionalTokens
        bytes32 questionId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(seasonId, player));
        conditionalTokens.reportPayouts(questionId, payouts);
        
        // Mark as resolved
        resolved[conditionId] = true;
        
        emit ConditionResolved(conditionId, seasonId, player, playerWon, payouts);
    }
}
```

**What it does**:
- Takes season ID, array of players, and winner address
- Loops through all players and resolves their conditions
- Sets payout to [1, 0] for winner (YES wins)
- Sets payout to [0, 1] for losers (NO wins)
- Reports to ConditionalTokens for redemption

### 2. Added redeemPositionTx() Function

**File**: `src/services/onchainInfoFi.js`

```javascript
export async function redeemPositionTx({ seasonId, player, networkKey = 'LOCAL' }) {
  // 1. Get FPMM address for this player/season
  const fpmmAddress = await publicClient.readContract({
    address: addrs.INFOFI_FPMM,
    abi: fpmmManagerAbi,
    functionName: 'getMarket',
    args: [BigInt(seasonId), getAddress(player)],
  });
  
  // 2. Get condition ID from FPMM
  const conditionId = await publicClient.readContract({
    address: fpmmAddress,
    abi: fpmmAbi,
    functionName: 'conditionId',
  });
  
  // 3. Redeem both YES and NO positions
  const indexSets = [1, 2]; // 0b01 (YES), 0b10 (NO)
  
  const hash = await walletClient.writeContract({
    address: addrs.CONDITIONAL_TOKENS,
    abi: conditionalTokensAbi,
    functionName: 'redeemPositions',
    args: [
      addrs.SOF,                    // collateralToken
      '0x0000...0000',              // parentCollectionId (empty)
      conditionId,                  // conditionId
      indexSets                     // indexSets [1, 2]
    ],
    account: from,
  });
  
  await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
  return hash;
}
```

**What it does**:
- Gets the FPMM market address for a specific player
- Retrieves the condition ID from the FPMM contract
- Calls ConditionalTokens.redeemPositions() with both YES and NO index sets
- Converts winning conditional tokens back to SOF collateral
- Returns transaction hash

### 3. Updated ClaimCenter Component

**File**: `src/components/infofi/ClaimCenter.jsx`

#### Added Imports
```javascript
import { 
  enumerateAllMarkets, 
  readBetFull, 
  claimPayoutTx, 
  redeemPositionTx,      // NEW
  readFpmmPosition       // NEW
} from '@/services/onchainInfoFi';
```

#### Implemented FPMM Claims Query
```javascript
const fpmmClaimsQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['claimcenter_fpmm_claimables', address, netKey, (discovery.data || []).length],
  enabled: !!address && Array.isArray(discovery.data),
  queryFn: async () => {
    const out = [];
    // Get unique seasons from discovered markets
    const seasons = new Set((discovery.data || []).map(m => Number(m.seasonId)));
    
    for (const seasonId of seasons) {
      // Get all players in this season
      const playersInSeason = new Set(
        (discovery.data || [])
          .filter(m => Number(m.seasonId) === seasonId)
          .map(m => m.player)
          .filter(Boolean)
      );
      
      // Check each player's market for user's positions
      for (const player of playersInSeason) {
        const yesPosition = await readFpmmPosition({
          seasonId, player, account: address,
          prediction: true, networkKey: netKey
        });
        
        const noPosition = await readFpmmPosition({
          seasonId, player, account: address,
          prediction: false, networkKey: netKey
        });
        
        // If user has positions, add to claimables
        if (yesPosition.amount > 0n || noPosition.amount > 0n) {
          out.push({
            seasonId, player,
            yesAmount: yesPosition.amount,
            noAmount: noPosition.amount,
            type: 'fpmm'
          });
        }
      }
    }
    return out;
  },
});
```

#### Implemented Redemption Mutation
```javascript
const claimFPMMOne = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async ({ seasonId, player }) => {
    return redeemPositionTx({ seasonId, player, networkKey: netKey });
  },
  onSuccess: () => {
    qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['claimcenter_fpmm_claimables'] });
    qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['infoFiPositions'] });
  },
});
```

#### Updated UI Display
```javascript
if (r.type === 'fpmm') {
  const totalAmount = (r.yesAmount ?? 0n) + (r.noAmount ?? 0n);
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between border rounded p-2 bg-blue-50/50">
      <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
        <span className="font-semibold text-blue-600">FPMM Market</span> • 
        Player: {String(r.player).slice(0, 6)}...{String(r.player).slice(-4)} • 
        YES: {formatUnits(r.yesAmount ?? 0n, 18)} • 
        NO: {formatUnits(r.noAmount ?? 0n, 18)} • 
        Total: {formatUnits(totalAmount, 18)} SOF
      </div>
      <Button 
        variant="outline" 
        onClick={() => claimFPMMOne.mutate({ seasonId: r.seasonId, player: r.player })}
        disabled={claimFPMMOne.isPending}
      >
        {claimFPMMOne.isPending ? 'Claiming...' : 'Redeem'}
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## How It Works Now (Complete Flow)

### 1. Market Creation
```
InfoFiMarketFactory → RaffleOracleAdapter.preparePlayerCondition()
→ ConditionalTokens.prepareCondition()
→ InfoFiFPMMV2Manager.createMarket()
→ SimpleFPMM deployed with conditionId
```

### 2. User Trading
```
User → SimpleFPMM.buy()
→ ConditionalTokens.splitPosition() (SOF → YES + NO tokens)
→ Transfer outcome tokens to user
→ User holds ERC1155 conditional tokens
```

### 3. Season Resolution (After VRF)
```
VRF determines winner
→ RaffleOracleAdapter.batchResolveSeasonMarkets()
→ Loop through all players
→ ConditionalTokens.reportPayouts() for each player
→ Winner: [1, 0], Losers: [0, 1]
→ Markets resolved, ready for redemption
```

### 4. User Redemption
```
User opens ClaimCenter
→ ClaimCenter queries all FPMM positions via readFpmmPosition()
→ Displays claimable positions
→ User clicks "Redeem"
→ redeemPositionTx() called
→ ConditionalTokens.redeemPositions()
→ Winning tokens converted to SOF
→ SOF transferred to user's wallet ✅
```

---

## Files Modified in Phase 4

1. ✅ `src/services/onchainInfoFi.js` - Added `redeemPositionTx()`
2. ✅ `src/components/infofi/ClaimCenter.jsx` - Implemented FPMM claims

**Note**: `RaffleOracleAdapter.sol` already had `batchResolveSeasonMarkets()` implemented!

---

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] `redeemPositionTx()` - Test redemption logic
- [ ] ClaimCenter FPMM query - Test position detection
- [ ] ClaimCenter redemption mutation - Test transaction flow

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Create market → Trade → Resolve → Redeem (full flow)
- [ ] Multiple users redeeming from same market
- [ ] Redemption with only YES or only NO positions
- [ ] Redemption after partial trading

### E2E Tests Needed
- [ ] Full season: Create → Trade → VRF → Resolve → Redeem
- [ ] Winner redeems YES tokens (gets SOF)
- [ ] Loser redeems NO tokens (gets SOF)
- [ ] UI updates after redemption

---

## Compilation Status

✅ **All code compiles successfully**
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ built in 13.63s
```

**No errors, only expected warnings**:
- Console statement in ClaimCenter (for debugging)
- Pre-existing linting issues in other files

---

## What's Next: Phase 5 - Testing & Deployment

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Contracts**
   ```bash
   # Start Anvil
   anvil --gas-limit 30000000
   
   # Deploy contracts (includes ConditionalTokens)
   cd contracts
   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
   
   # Update environment
   cd ..
   node scripts/update-env-addresses.js
   node scripts/copy-abis.js
   ```

2. **Create Season & Trade**
   ```bash
   # Create season (triggers InfoFi market creation)
   # Buy tickets (creates FPMM markets)
   # Place bets (buy YES/NO positions)
   ```

3. **Resolve Season**
   ```bash
   # VRF determines winner
   # Call RaffleOracleAdapter.batchResolveSeasonMarkets()
   # Markets resolved
   ```

4. **Test Redemption**
   - Open ClaimCenter in UI
   - Should show claimable FPMM positions
   - Click "Redeem"
   - Verify SOF received

### Testing Priorities

1. **Critical Path** (Must work):
   - Buy position → Query position → Shows in UI ✅
   - Resolve market → Redeem position → Receive SOF

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Redeem with only YES tokens
   - Redeem with only NO tokens
   - Multiple redemptions from same user
   - Redemption after market expires

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Redeem before resolution (should fail)
   - Redeem with no positions (should skip)
   - Redeem twice (should fail second time)
