# $SOF Transaction History Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive $SOF transaction history feature for the User Profile page that displays all types of $SOF-related transactions including transfers, bonding curve trades, prize claims, and fee collections.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Transaction Tracking

The system tracks and displays the following transaction types:

- **Direct Transfers**: Incoming and outgoing $SOF transfers
- **Bonding Curve Trades**: 
  - Buy transactions (TokensPurchased events)
  - Sell transactions (TokensSold events)
- **Prize Claims**:
  - Grand Prize claims
  - Consolation Prize claims
- **Fee Collections**: Platform fees collected by admin/treasury addresses

### 2. Performance Optimizations

#### Chunked Block Range Queries

- Uses `queryLogsInChunks` utility to handle RPC provider block range limitations
- Prevents timeouts on networks with large block ranges
- Automatically reduces chunk size if RPC limits are hit
- Default chunk size: 10,000 blocks with automatic fallback to smaller chunks

#### Configurable Lookback Period

- Default: 500,000 blocks
  - ~11.5 days on Base (2-second blocks)
  - ~57 days on Ethereum (12-second blocks)
- Customizable via `lookbackBlocks` option

### 3. User Interface

#### Summary Statistics

- **Total Received**: Sum of all incoming $SOF
- **Total Sent**: Sum of all outgoing $SOF
- **Net Flow**: Difference between received and sent
- **Total Transactions**: Count of all transactions

#### Filtering System

- **All**: Show all transactions
- **Received**: Only incoming transactions
- **Sent**: Only outgoing transactions
- **Trades**: Only bonding curve buy/sell transactions
- **Prizes**: Only prize claim transactions

#### Transaction Display

- Color-coded amounts (green for IN, red for OUT)
- Transaction type badges with appropriate styling
- Detailed descriptions for each transaction type
- Links to block explorer for transaction verification
- Timestamp display with locale formatting
- Pagination (20 items per page)

### 4. Real-Time Updates

- Automatic refetch every 60 seconds
- 30-second stale time for optimal performance
- React Query integration for efficient caching

## Files Created

### Hook
- `src/hooks/useSOFTransactions.js` - Main transaction fetching hook with chunked queries

### Component
- `src/components/user/SOFTransactionHistory.jsx` - Transaction history UI component

### Tests
- `tests/hooks/useSOFTransactions.test.jsx` - Comprehensive unit tests (4/4 passing)

### Translations
- Updated `public/locales/en/account.json` with transaction history labels

## Integration

The transaction history component is integrated into the User Profile page (`src/routes/UserProfile.jsx`) and appears:

- Below the $SOF balance card
- Above the raffle holdings section
- For both own account view and viewing other users

## Technical Implementation

### Event Fetching Strategy

1. **Get current block number** from RPC
2. **Calculate fromBlock** based on lookback period
3. **Fetch events in parallel** using chunked queries:
   - Transfer events (IN and OUT)
   - Bonding curve events (Buy and Sell)
   - Prize claim events (Grand and Consolation)
   - Fee collection events
4. **Fetch block timestamps** for each transaction
5. **Sort by block number** (most recent first)

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if specific event types cannot be fetched
- Silent failures for optional events (bonding curve, prizes, fees)
- Proper error display in UI if main query fails

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:

```bash
✓ should fetch and categorize transactions correctly
✓ should handle empty transaction history
✓ should not fetch when address is not provided
✓ should respect enabled option
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied

1. **Chunked queries** prevent RPC timeouts
2. **Parallel fetching** of different event types
3. **React Query caching** reduces redundant requests
4. **Configurable lookback** limits data volume
5. **Pagination** improves UI performance with large datasets

### Potential Future Improvements

- **Indexer integration** for faster historical data retrieval
- **Virtual scrolling** for very large transaction lists
- **Export functionality** (CSV/JSON download)
- **Advanced filtering** (date ranges, amount ranges)
- **Search functionality** (by transaction hash, address)

## Usage Example

```jsx
import { SOFTransactionHistory } from '@/components/user/SOFTransactionHistory';

// In UserProfile component
<SOFTransactionHistory address={userAddress} />

// With custom lookback period
<SOFTransactionHistory 
  address={userAddress} 
  options={{ lookbackBlocks: 100000n }} 
/>
```

## Conclusion

The $SOF Transaction History feature provides users with complete visibility into their $SOF token activity across all platform interactions. The chunked query implementation ensures reliable performance even on networks with strict RPC limits, while the comprehensive UI makes it easy to understand transaction patterns and verify on-chain activity.
