# InfoFi Panel Redesign Summary

## Overview

Redesigned the InfoFi prediction markets interface with a Polymarket-inspired grid layout and fixed the odds updating mechanism.

## Changes Made

### 1. InfoFiMarketCard Component Redesign

**File:** `src/components/infofi/InfoFiMarketCard.jsx`

#### Visual Changes

- **Polymarket-style outcome buttons**: Large percentage displays with background fill indicators
  - YES button: Green theme with percentage fill from left
  - NO button: Red theme with percentage fill from left
  - Both show complementary percentages (YES% + NO% = 100%)
  - **Dynamic payout display**: Shows potential payout and profit for current bet amount
    - Default: Shows payout for 1 SOF bet
    - Live update: Automatically scales to user's input amount
    - Profit calculation: Displays net profit after stake deduction

- **Cleaner header**: Market question with player info and season link in a vertical layout

- **Condensed volume display**: Moved to a subtle footer with market ID

- **Collapsible positions**: User positions only show when they exist, in a highlighted box

- **Streamlined trading**: Single-row input with color-coded trade button

- **Smart claim buttons**: Only appear when user has positions, disabled when no claimable amount

#### Payout Calculation System

- **Real-time payout calculation**: `calculatePayout(betAmount, isYes)`
  - Formula: `payout = betAmount / (probability / 100)`
  - Returns total payout including stake

- **Profit calculation**: `calculateProfit(betAmount, isYes)`
  - Formula: `profit = payout - betAmount`
  - Shows net gain if bet wins

- **Smart formatting**: Adapts display based on amount
  - Large amounts: "1.5k SOF"
  - Medium amounts: "150 SOF"
  - Small amounts: "1.50 SOF"

#### Technical Improvements

- Removed debug console statements
- Better percentage clamping (0-100% range)
- Improved responsive layout with hover effects
- Cleaner prop validation

### 2. MarketsIndex Grid Layout

**File:** `src/routes/MarketsIndex.jsx`

#### Layout Changes

- **Responsive grid**: 
  - 1 column on mobile
  - 2 columns on tablet (md breakpoint)
  - 3 columns on desktop (lg breakpoint)

- **Polymarket-style sections**: Each market type gets its own section with count badge

- **Better spacing**: Increased vertical spacing between sections (space-y-8)

- **Centered empty states**: Card-based empty states for better UX

- **Max-width container**: Content constrained to 7xl for better readability on large screens

#### Technical Improvements

- Removed unused imports (Link, CardHeader, CardTitle)
- Cleaner error state handling
- Better loading state presentation

### 3. Odds Updating Fix

**File:** `src/hooks/useOraclePriceLive.js`

#### Problem Solved

The oracle price (market odds) wasn't updating when player positions changed in the raffle, causing stale probability displays.

#### Solution

- Added React Query cache subscription to listen for `playerSnapshot` query updates
- When position snapshots change, trigger a refresh of the oracle price
- This ensures odds update in real-time as players buy/sell tickets

#### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Listen to position snapshot changes to trigger price refresh
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = queryClient.getQueryCache().subscribe((event) => {
    if (event?.query?.queryKey?.[0] === 'playerSnapshot') {
      setRefreshTrigger(prev => prev + 1)
    }
  })
  return () => unsubscribe()
}, [queryClient])
```

### 4. Translation Updates

**File:** `public/locales/en/market.json`

Added missing translation keys:
- `browseActiveMarkets`: "Browse and trade on active prediction markets"
- `positionSize`: "Position Size"
- `behavioral`: "Behavioral"
- `other`: "Other"
- `trade`: "Trade"

### 5. Lint Fixes

- Fixed empty catch block in `useOnchainInfoFiMarkets.js`
- Removed unused imports across components
- Removed debug console statements

## User Experience Improvements

### Before

- Markets displayed in vertical list with basic cards
- Odds displayed as small circular indicators
- Positions always visible even when zero
- No visual hierarchy between market types
- Odds didn't update when positions changed

### After

- Markets in responsive grid (1-3 columns based on screen size)
- Large, prominent percentage displays with visual fill indicators
- Positions only show when user has them
- Clear section headers with market type counts
- Real-time odds updates when positions change
- Polymarket-inspired professional design

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Testing**
   - Check grid responsiveness at different screen sizes
   - Verify percentage displays update correctly
   - Test hover states on market cards
   - Verify payout displays update as user types bet amount

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Buy raffle tickets and verify odds update in real-time
   - Place bets and verify position display
   - Test claim functionality when markets resolve
   - Verify payout calculations are accurate for various bet amounts
   - Test edge cases (0% odds, 100% odds, very large amounts)

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor query invalidation frequency
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders
   - Verify WebSocket connections don't leak
   - Test payout calculation performance with rapid input changes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Market Filtering**: Add filters by market type, volume, or activity
2. **Sorting Options**: Allow sorting by volume, newest, ending soon
3. **Market Search**: Search markets by player address or question
4. **Chart Integration**: Add price history charts to market cards
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize for mobile trading experience
